This repository shares R scripts and data associate to:

*"Multi-habitat landscapes support diversity, stability and improved function"* by Hackett T.D., Sauve A.M.C, Maia K.P., Montoya D., Tylianakis J., Potts S., Vaughan I., Memmott J.

Analyses are separated in the following folders:

* `emergent_properties` contains R scripts to test whether the network properties we measured
on sites combining multiple habitats are different than expected if landscape scale food
webs were only the sum of their habitats.

* `phylogenetic_trees` provides the scripts to i) create a phylogenetic tree including all encountered plant taxa and ii) calculate phylogenetic diversity.

* `robustness_analysis` contains R scripts to calculate the robustness of landscape-scale food webs to 1) the extinction of the least to most common plant species (landscape homogeneisation), and to 2) random extinctions (species loss *per se*).

* `sampling_completeness` gathers R scripts to calculate sampling completeness in the sampled networks, and their effects on the results presented in the manuscript.

* `shared_habitat_variation` explores variations in plant communities across sites.

* `strawberry-experiment-analysis_functional-dispersion` gathers R scripts to analyse the functional response to the diversity of habitats within landscape (strawberry experiment) and to explore the associated interaction complementarity (or functional dispersion).

* `structure_manova` extracts diversity and structural metrics and analyses the effect of number of habitats on community diversity and structure.

* `surrounding_habitats` examines the relationship between the surrounding habitat patch area of each monad and several structural metrics.

The data analysed in this manuscript are gathered in the folder `data`.
