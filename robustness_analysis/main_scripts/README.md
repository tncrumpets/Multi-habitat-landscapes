# Main scripts to evaluate network robustness following 3 extinction scenarios of plant species within each sampled site

* `robustness_script_ls_weighted.R` : This script performs a robustness analysis on the 30 sites prospected for the "landscape scale food webs" project. This robustness analysis includes rewiring, with interaction frequencies distributed in proportion to the abundance of the newly forage resource/prey. It also delete one species if one of its life stages cannot feed on anything.

* `mean-sd_robustness.R` : This script calculcates the mean and the standard deviation of robustness for each of the 30 sites sampled for the "landscape scale food webs" project.

* `robustness_figures.R` : This script draws the cumulative secondary extinction curves following plants removal in each sites sampled by Hackett et al., as well as the figures presented in the manuscript (fig. 3) and the extended data file (fig. 11 and fig. 12).
