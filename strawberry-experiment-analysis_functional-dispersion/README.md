This folder gathers the analyses associated with the strawberry experiment and functional dispersion:
	* `functional-response-analysis_strawberries.R` tests the effet of habitat diversity within landscapes on ftuit weight and class. It is followed by the interaction complementarity analysis which tests whether this could correlates with a more complementary use of floral ressources by the pollinator community.
	* `focus_functional-dispersion.R` presents the whole interaction complementarity analysis presented in the main text to investigate whether pollinator communities of sites with more habitats use floral resources in more complementary ways, from computing the dissimilarity in pollinators' resoure use to performing a PCoA and assessing the quality of the functional space thus created.
	* `focus_functional-dispersion_supporting-info.R` provides the supplementary analysis on interaction complementarity to test the robustness of the results to insects sampling completeness.
	* `response2rev_amount-singletons.R` verifies that there is no significant differences in the number and proportion of singletons among monads, dyads and triads.
	
Input data are stored in `../data`, and more specifically in `../data/strawberry_experiment` for tables describing fruit weights and quality class.
